🚀 LeetCode Multi-Language Solutions
A comprehensive collection of LeetCode problem solutions implemented across the modern development stack: C#, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Dart. This repository is designed for developers practicing for interviews, learning new language syntaxes, or exploring algorithmic efficiency.

🎯 Why This Repository?
Comparative Learning: Side-by-side analysis of how the same algorithm is expressed in different paradigms.

Language Migration: Perfect for developers transitioning (e.g., from Java/C# to Dart for Flutter, or JS to TypeScript).

Best Practices: Each solution adheres to language-specific conventions (e.g., LINQ in C#, STL in C++, ES6+ in JS).

Complexity Analysis: Every solution includes documented Big O time and space complexity.

🗂️ Repository Structure

🔧 Language-Specific Highlights
C#: Leverages modern features like LINQ, pattern matching, and xUnit for testing.

C++: Focuses on STL efficiency, memory management, and modern C++20 standards.

JS/TS: Utilizes ES6+ functional programming (Map, Reduce, Filter) and strict TypeScript interfaces.

Dart: Fully null-safe codebases following official Dart linting rules, ready for Flutter integration.
